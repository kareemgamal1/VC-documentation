Abstract

Despite significant advancements in recent years, voice conversion still lags behind text generation in terms of performance and versatility. This paper presents an innovative method for enhancing voice cloning by combining multiple models and modifying their parameters. By adjusting these settings and merging their outputs, we create a more robust and effective model. Through extensive testing, we demonstrate that our modified ensemble model's performance is better than that of each individual model, yielding higher-quality synthetic voices. This approach not only enhances voice cloning but also extends its utility to various applications such as speech-enabled devices and multimedia content creation. By advancing voice cloning technology, this research contributes to improving communication, entertainment, and assistive technologies.


Introduction:


Motivation:

The motivation behind our work stems from the significant advancements observed in text generation compared to voice conversion technologies. While text-based models have made remarkable progress, enabling diverse applications across various domains, voice cloning techniques have lagged behind. This discrepancy underscores a critical gap in the development of artificial voices in comparison to written text.
One significant aspect of our work involves leveraging Text-To-Speech (TTS) models. These models are responsible for converting written text into spoken words, such as when a device reads aloud what is typed. However, the voices generated by TTS often lack the natural nuances present in human speech, detracting from their realism.
Incorporating TTS into our methodology involves utilizing a pretrained voice generated from the user's text input as the target. By employing this approach, we aim to enhance the fidelity and naturalness of synthesized voices, bridging the gap between artificial and human speech.
Furthermore, preserving and replicating the unique qualities of human voices holds significant importance. Whether it's for cherishing the memories of loved ones or preserving the distinct style of a renowned Quran reciter, current models struggle to accurately capture these nuances. This limitation hampers their utility in practical applications and underscores the need for improvement.

Problem Statement:

Our primary objective is to address the disparity between text generation and voice conversion technologies by enhancing voice cloning methodologies. Current models often fail to capture the intricacies of human speech, resulting in synthetic voices that lack naturalness and fidelity.
To tackle this challenge, we propose incorporating TTS models into our approach. By utilizing pretrained voices generated from user text input as targets, we aim to improve the quality and authenticity of synthesized voices.
Furthermore, we recognize the importance of accurately preserving and replicating human voices for various applications. However, existing models struggle to achieve this effectively, limiting their usefulness in practical scenarios. Our goal is to develop techniques that overcome these limitations, enabling more accurate and natural voice cloning for a wide range of applications.
